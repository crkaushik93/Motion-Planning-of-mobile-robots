# Motion-Planning-of-mobile-robots

Here wehvae discussed about the motion planning of the robot and its different types.

The  theory developed and dicussed is based on many reference materials which has been combined and projected in the website given below:

We discussed the 
Motion planning of mobile robots and a project where  we are finding the motion planning by using the Dijkstra's Algorithm and The A Star (A*) algorithm for 
which the code is created in python. The results are shown below.
